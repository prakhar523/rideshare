# Ride Share Case Study

#Intro 

This case study was done as part of the Data Science Immersive program at Galvanize. My partner Cynthia and I were given 7 hours to analyze data from a ride share company, and prepare a presentation that addressed the problem. The problem was presented as such:

#(Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. Identify what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Company X.
