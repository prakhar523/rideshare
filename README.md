# Ride Share Case Study

#Intro 

This case study was done as part of my enrollment in the Data Science Immersive program at Galvanize. My partner Cynthia and I were given 7 hours from start to finish to analyze data from a ride share company and prepare a presentation that answered the following questions:

  - How did you compute the target?
  - What model did you use in the end? Why?
  - Alternative models you considered? Why are they not good enough?
  - What performance metric did you use? Why?
  - Based on insights from the model, what actionable plans do you propose to reduce churn?
